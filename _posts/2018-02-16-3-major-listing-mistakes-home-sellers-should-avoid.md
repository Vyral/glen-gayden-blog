There are three main mistakes you must avoid when putting your home on the market.
{: .present-before-paste}

The first is **asking for too much**. Of course, you don’t want to leave any money on the table or undersell your home, but you do want to make sure its price is in line with market value. If your home isn’t priced appropriately, there’s a good chance it will linger on the market and you’ll sell it for less than you would have if you had originally priced it correctly.

The second mistake to avoid is **too little marketing**. Sometimes, sellers hire the wrong real estate agent who doesn’t have the extensive reach necessary to get the most exposure for their home. With exposure comes traffic. With traffic comes offers. Offers, finally, bring sales.

Make sure you hire an agent who will expose your home to every medium possible. Whoever you work with shouldn’t settle for just snapping a couple photos of the home, throwing those up on the MLS, and putting an advertisement in the paper. You have to pull out all the stops when marketing your property. The home isn’t going to sell itself.

The last mistake to avoid is **making a bad presentation.** By “presentation,” I mean the home’s layout, decorations, smell, etc. when a buyer walks into your home, every aspect of it should be 100% in line with where you want it to be so you can convert that potential buyer into a sale.
