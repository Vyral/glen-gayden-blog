In this latest episode of “The New Construction Insider,” I’m in Katy, Texas at Meritage Homes’ newest community: Silver Ranch. Joining me is Ginger Gayden, one of Meritage Homes’ sales representatives (and my lovely wife).

In Silver Ranch, **homes start in the $270,000 range and go as high as $350,000.** This community features a community pool, a tennis court, parks, a barbecue pavilion, and several walking trails.

Silver Ranch is also conveniently located only about a mile west of Cinco Ranch. If you’re familiar with that area, then you know how great the community vibe is. The only difference is that in Silver Ranch, you don’t have to pay the high HOA fees and you don’t have to sacrifice on any of the amenities. Additionally, the schools in the area all carry an exemplary rating.

Meritage Homes is renown builder, but according to Ginger, **what makes them the go-to choice for purchasing a home in Silver Ranch is their energy savings.**

“We’re 100% Energy Star, so we factor in your savings after you’ve actually made the large purchase,” she says.

What kind of incentives is Meritage Homes offering?

For dirt builds, they offer a $20,000 allowance, which can be used at the design studio or taken from the base price of the home as a reduction. This incentive also comes with a 1% BTSA. For inventory homes, they’ll have large reductions from the MLS, free covered patios, and the same 1% BTSA.

**Meritage also offers a preferred lender incentive.** They partner with MTH Mortgage, so if you work with them to secure a mortgage loan when buying a home in Silver Ranch, you get a $6,000 incentive—$5,000 toward your closing costs and $1,000 toward your title policy.

If you reach out to our team and allow us to facilitate your Silver Ranch home purchase, we’ll give you an additional 1.5% to either put back toward your closing costs, deduct from the overall price, or add another option.

If you have any more questions about buying a home in Silver Ranch or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
