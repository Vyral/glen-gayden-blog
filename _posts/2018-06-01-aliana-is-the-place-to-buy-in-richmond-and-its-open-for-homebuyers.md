For the latest edition of “The New Construction Insider,” I’m in Richmond, Texas visiting a Highland Homes development in the city’s Aliana neighborhood. Joining me is Troy Varshochi, one of Highland Homes’ sales representatives.

Why is Aliana the choice to make when moving to the Richmond area?

According to Troy, **the answer is location**. Aliana lies in the heart of Richmond, and it’s unique because it’s not a big development like some of the other surrounding communities. It’s owned by a developer that only manages Aliana, so they can focus all of their attention on it and make sure it fulfills buyers’ expectations. Their theme is more luxury-oriented, and their quality control is spot on.

There are plenty of great recreation opportunities for families in Aliana, the most notable being The Club at Aliana clubhouse. This multimillion dollar facility features three pools, a full gym, tennis courts, and a full kitchen that you can rent out. Right down the street from this clubhouse sits the Westmoor Club, which offers the same amenities on a slightly smaller scale. There are also plenty of parks, trails, shopping centers throughout the area. On top of that, there’s still a lot of room for growth. Up and down Highway 99 you can see plenty of new development happening.

As far as price points go, **homes in this development start in the $320,000 range and stretch into the $400,000 bracket.** Highland Homes has 17 design plans to choose from and each one is customizable, so if you want to personalize your home even further, they can do that for you.

When it comes to education, Fort Bend ISD is a very popular school district which features some of the best schools in Fort Bend, including Travis High School, Austin High School, Oyster Creek Elementary, Madden Elementary, and Garcia Middle School.

Lastly, Highland Homes offers some great buyer incentives. **They have their own lender and title company in-house, and if you use that lender, they can offer $10,000 toward your closing costs.** This also makes the loan process that much easier for you.

As another incentive, if you use the Gayden Team to buy a home in Aliana, we’ll throw another 1.5% back toward your closing costs, reduce the list price, or add an option or feature.

I want to thank Troy for joining me today to tell us all about Aliana. If you have any other questions about this development or you’re thinking about buying a home here, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. My team and I would love to help you.
