Elyson is one of the hottest new properties in Katy. In addition to its great location, what I love about Elyson is the amount of options you have if you decide to live there. There are eight different builders with 94 different floor plans that range in price from $250,000 to $600,000. There really is something for everyone.
<br>
<br>Some of the amenities include a huge swimming pool, a clubhouse/restaurant, exercise facility, and a game room. **Elyson also offers playgrounds, walking trails, and is nearby some great public parks.** The community is zoned to Katy ISD, a phenomenal public school district and arguably the best in the Houston area. With the lifestyle the community provides, Elyson is a great place for people of all walks of life.

<br>
<br>The only concerning detail I have about the community is the tax rate, which is at 3.75% prior to homestead. **Overall, I give Elyson two thumbs up and I think we are seeing the development of the next Cinco Ranch.**
<br>
<br>If you have any further questions for me about Elyson or want to schedule a neighborhood tour for yourself, donâ€™t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
