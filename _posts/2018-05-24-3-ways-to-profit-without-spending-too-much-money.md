Today I want to talk to you about three easy ways that you can generate leads, build your business, and ultimately profit without spending too much money.

**1. Wear a name tag.** Wearing a name tag with your name, your company, and your position on it while you’re out and about is a good way to let strangers know that you work in real estate and can possibly open up conversations about any needs they might have. This can open up opportunities for business and chances to grow your database.&nbsp;

**2. Open houses.** These are a good way to generate business quickly. The more people you can market to, the more people you’ll be able to sell homes to. If you don’t have any listings or inventory, you can always reach out to new construction sales counselors to ask them if you can hold one of their inventory homes open during the weekend. You can reach out to the top agents in your market; chances are that they’ll be too busy to do open houses for every single listing they’ve taken on.

**3. Talk to those who already know you.** Oftentimes we put a lot of effort into trying to impress people we don’t know in order to win their business. However, you can also focus on those you do already know and try to maintain and strengthen preexisting relationships.&nbsp;

These three things alone can change your life and your business; if you do them diligently, persistently, and consistently, you’ll see an increase in revenue and quality of life. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
