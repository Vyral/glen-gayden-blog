Today I want to talk to you about a topic that irritates me a little bit: renting versus buying.

A lot of people out in the market right now are under the impression that renting is going to save them money, as opposed to buying. A lot of people are also under the impression that in order to buy a home you have to put 20% down. **Neither of these is the case at all.**

I get a lot of phone calls from people who tell me they need to rent because they can’t afford to buy a home right now. I always ask them if they’ve even gotten confirmation from a lender that you can’t afford to buy right now. If someone can afford $2,000 a month to rent a house, I can guarantee that you can have that same house for $1,600 or $1,700 a month for mortgage, **which would also build you equity and wealth.**

The National Association of Realtors released a study earlier this year that stated that **renting a home would cost 33% more** than it would if you were to buy that same home.

We’ve got to change this misunderstanding about the loan process and the home buying process.

I can get you set up with some fantastic **lenders that will show you all kinds of available programs and save you money** in the short term and the long term with low interest rates. That way, you’re not paying an egregious amount of money to the bank over the next 30 years.

If you’re interested in that, give me a call or send me an email and we’ll get this ball rolling for you. It’s really quick and simple, and we can have you in a new home as soon as possible, whether you’re a first-time buyer or an experienced buyer. We look forward to hearing from you!
