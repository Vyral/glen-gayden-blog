Today let’s discuss the benefits of working with a real estate team vs. working with an individual agent to help you buy or sell a home. **First, let’s look at what you’ll get by hiring an individual agent.**

An individual agent can only make one phone call at a time and write one email at a time. If multiple things are happening at once, it’s nearly impossible for them to manage all those moving parts.

**An individual agent can only be in one place at a time.** If the’re out showing a property and a time-sensitive offer comes in on your home, the ball might get dropped. Things can fall through the cracks pretty easily.

The agent likely has only one database to go along with their limited lead generation time. With all the different things that need to be done in a transaction these days, they won’t have as much time to prospect for homes.

With a team like ours, you get a lot more customer service and a lot more attention to detail. Each person on our team has their own database that we can market your listing to. **We also have an inside sales department whose sole task is to generate leads.**

Things are leveraged with a team and we approach the transaction like an assembly line. Everything is streamline and there are systems in place to make sure you are represented in the best way possible.

I love individual agents and have great respect for them. However, the future of high-level real estate is the team structure. **Working with a team is the way to go.**
