In today’s episode of The New Construction Insider, I’m meeting up with my good friend John Ricke. John told me all about Jordan Ranch, a new Johnson Development project in Brookshire, Texas. This area was voted the number one place to raise a family by the Houston Chronicle.

This community feature great amenities, including a pool and lazy river opening this summer. They also have a baseball field, soccer field, and community garden in the works to open next year.

Lennar Homes is proud to be the only builder to be Wi-Fi certified, meaning that no matter how many devices you have or what part of the home you’re in, you will not lose internet connection.

They are offering two product lines- the Fairfield Series ($230k+) and the Texas Reserve Series ($376k+). Currently, Lennar Homes is offering $5-15k in incentives for new buyers. Additionally, if you use the Gayden team, you will get an additional 1.5% incentive toward closing costs, reduction in price, or additional features.

If you have any questions about buying a home in Jordan Ranch or you have any other real estate needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to help you.
